<p>Row level security is a great capability in Power BI. It gives you the ability to have 100s of different views of the data without creating 100s of different reports. But it is not without drawbacks.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When RLS is applied no other data is accessible by the measures you create. That is the main goal of RLS, but it restricts for example the ability to compare your performance with peers. Like for a store manager how he ranks across all the stores.</p>
