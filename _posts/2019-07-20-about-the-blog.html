<p>Hello everyone, </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This blog is about <strong>Self-Service BI</strong> using Microsoft`s Azure and Power BI tool sets. Focusing on the benefits and problems organizations face when try to adopt this new way of <strong>driving decisions with data</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There will be longer posts about general topics in the <strong>Big Picture</strong> section, like how to generate value, report life cycle or what kind of self service levels are available.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I would like to talk about how you can improve the experience of the consumer and fellow creators by applying some best practices in the <strong>Improve the Experience</strong> section.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The <strong>Analytics Edge</strong> section will contain deep dive pieces about certain capabilities\techniques that will help you get more/better insights from your data.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My name is <strong>Mihaly Kavasi</strong>. I am a practicing consultant working with data and self-service BI tools.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Currently I mainly use the Microsoft cloud stack, where I am also a trainer. Previously I worked with other tools like Tableau.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I regularly see <strong>good and bad examples</strong> of how organizations start their journey to become a data-driven organization, and certain <strong>patterns</strong> emerged that seem to be universal<strong> for success</strong>. That led me to start this blog.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I would like use this platform to organize my thoughts, share it with you and based on feedback improve my understanding about how to best approach this task of<strong> helping organizations reach their goals using data.</strong></p>
